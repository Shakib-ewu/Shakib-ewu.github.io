## Portfolio Generator
The original UI, CSS and design is done by [Sadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee) and taken from [here](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio). The template was updated and was given a simpler look suitable for CS graduates by [Apurba Saha](https://github.com/diponsaha007). 

## Templating
The original project is based on pure html and css.
